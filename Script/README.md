# Deployment
Notice that the volume is pre-existed since all data stored cannot be retrieved on a new-created volume. <br>
The playbook is able to build multiple instances from 'nothing' to 'everything'. <br>
After each time creating the instances, the playbook is able to catch the new ip address generated and store that ip address as hosts (or hosts-in-memory). 
There are more modules used in the playbook and you can go through the instructions on the official [website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html)
